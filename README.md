# bitso-go

`bitso-go` is a Go wrapper around the [Bitso API][1] for the Bitso
Cryptocurrency Exchange.

```
go get -u github.com/xiam/bitso-go/bitso
```

## Examples

The example below prints fundings in your account:

```go
client := bitso.NewClient()
client.SetLogLevel(bitso.LogLevelDebug)

client.SetAuth(key, secret)

fundings, err := client.Fundings(nil)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("can not get fundings: ", err)
}

for _, funding := range fundings {
    log.Printf("%#v", funding)
}
```
